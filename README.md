# Static-and-Varying-Pattern-Classification-with-Gaussian-Mixture-models

## Implemented Probabilistic Approches for Image Classification:
* 1.Bayes Classifier with GMM-Gaussian Mixture Models for static pattern classification
* 2.Bayes Classifier with GMM-Gaussian Mixture Models for varying pattern classification
